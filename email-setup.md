```

# Check spam/junk folder

# Test with simple email first
```

### Test Email Connection
```javascript
// Test email functionality
const EmailConfig = require('./email-config');
const email = new EmailConfig();

// Test connection
email.testConnection().then(result => {
    console.log('Connection test:', result);
});

// Send test email
email.sendDailyReport(testReport).then(result => {
    console.log('Test email result:', result);
});
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Best Practices:
1. **Use App Passwords** - Never use your main account password
2. **Environment Variables** - Don't hardcode credentials
3. **Limited Access** - App passwords can be revoked anytime
4. **Regular Rotation** - Change app passwords periodically

### Gmail Security:
- App passwords are 16-character codes
- They bypass 2-factor authentication
- Can be revoked without affecting your main account
- Only work for specific applications

## 📱 Mobile Access

### Email Clients:
- **Gmail App** - Full HTML support
- **Outlook App** - Professional interface
- **Apple Mail** - iOS integration
- **Any Email Client** - Text version always works

### Mobile Features:
- **Responsive Design** - Optimized for small screens

## 🎯 Customization

### Modify Email Content:
```javascript
// Customize email templates
class CustomEmailConfig extends EmailConfig {
    generateEmailHTML(report) {
        // Your custom HTML template
        return customTemplate;
    }
}
```

### Add Custom Attachments:
```javascript
// Add custom file attachments
const customAttachments = [
    {
        filename: 'custom-report.pdf',
        content: pdfBuffer,
        contentType: 'application/pdf'
    }
